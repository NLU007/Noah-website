When I was just 2 years old, my parents introduced me to various sports in order to promote a healthy lifestyle and help me discover a hobby. It was during this exploration that I discovered my talent and passion for soccer. I quickly realized that I not only excelled at the sport, but I also found immense joy in playing as part of a team. The exhilaration of winning and the  efforts with my teammates became an integral part of my soccer journey. Ever since that great discovery, I have dedicated myself to the sport, consistently playing three times a week for the past 11 years. Soccer has become my main sport as it has become an integral part of my identity and a source of constant joy and fulfillment.

### Experience and Achievements as a Soccer Player

I have had the privilege of being a part of three remarkable soccer clubs throughout my journey:

1. [Adventure Sports Academy](https://www.adventuresportsacademy.com/)
2. [ChelseaFC in HK](https://chelseafchk.com/)
3. [Tai Tam Tigers](https://www.hkis.edu.hk/activities-arts-athletics/sports-academies/soccer-academy) (currently)

One of the highlights of my soccer experience was the opportunity to travel with my team to Bangkok for a highly competitive tournament. It was an incredible experience that broadened my horizons and allowed me to try some of my skills on an international stage.

Among the various positions I have tried, my favorite is right wing back. This position enables me to contribute to both offensive plays and defensive strategies. I find it to be very comfortable to be able to both supporting our team's attacks while also being a reliable pillar in our defense, making it a perfect balance between the two aspects of the game.

Last season, our team achieved an impressive top-three finish in the Junior Football League, which was a testament to our hard work and dedication. Additionally, I am proud to mention that I have earned a spot in our school's varsity team this year. Representing my school in the International School Sports Federation Hong Kong league is an honor that I am grateful about.
